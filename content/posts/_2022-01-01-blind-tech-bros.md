I have worked remotely since 2018, first as a six-months experiment at an otherwise non-remote company, later as a fully remote engineer at a mostly remote/distributed company.

Many posts on Blind end with something like the line above.

If you're not familiar with Blind, it is an anonymous forum where software developers talk about their salaries (and other things). When you combine those two things -- anonymity and salary discussion -- chances are high that the end result is like a yuppie Instagram where west coast tech bros brag about how many gazillions of dollars they make.

Personally I prefer to read about when things didn't go so well I've collected enough job interview failures that I thought they'd be an interesting read.
