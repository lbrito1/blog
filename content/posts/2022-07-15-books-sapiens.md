Sapiens has no central point being made; rather there's an intricate web of mostly interdependent theories and speculations. This makes for an enjoyable read, however at times it is easy to lose sight of the original premises used to build up on increasingly speculative conclusions.

Central to many of the ideas in the book is the absolute dismissal of any metaphysics. Harari does not waste any time explaining his point of view -- rather he states it as an axiom. I can't help but have the impression, though, that he ultimately indulges in some metaphysical speculations himself. The perfect, purely scientific explanations seem just around the corner, but prove more elusive than expected: the theme of Happiness is extensively discussed throughout the book, but a biological smoking gun is never delivered. Or rather, it is, but in acknowledging it Harari seems bitterly disappointed. This unfulfillment points to his own metaphysical beliefs.

His reflections on early humanity, what the author calls [Cognitive Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity) and the unforeseen consequences of the [Agricultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution) are the most interesting. Homo Sapiens' edge over the competing species was the ability to operate in shared imagined worlds, which eventually developed into modern states, currencies and religions. These shared worlds allow large numbers of individuals to cooperate towards large projects unfeasible to smaller bands. And while this might have hugely increased human population, it also meant worse living conditions for the average person: grain-based civilizations are more susceptible to famines, droughts and plagues than their hunter-gatherer predecessors.
