A couple of years ago I interviewed at one of the largest Ruby shops out there. Screening went well, and some days later I was invited for an onsite.

Well, what _is_ an onsite? I'd like to argue that an onsite is actually radically different depending on _who you are_ and _where you live_. It follows that onsites introduce further bias into our industry's already problematic hiring process.

If you're a local, an onsite probably means taking a bus, metro, taxi, walking, whatever. If you're not local but are at least within the same country that you're interviewing, it might take a day trip or maybe a short flight. If you're a foreigner it might take travel visas and a week of travel.

"Time is money", goes the catchphrase. Without getting too philosophical, we all know we have a limited amount of sand grains in our hourglass. [Fallacies apart](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sunk_cost), we intuitively know -- _feel_, even -- that the more time we pour into something, the higher the stakes become, be it renovating a kitchen or traveling for an onsite. Its glaringly obvious that someone who invested a 30 minute bus ride to an onsite will feel much more at ease than someone who flew red-eye. It doesn't really matter how much pampering the latter gets: fancy hotel stays, meal allowances -- investing a week of your time will always feel higher-stakes than taking an afternoon off work to casually visit a different office building in your city.

Back to my story: I was interviewing for a company overseas. I happened to have a valid visa for that country, which already puts me in some advantage compared to others. Physically getting to the company building for the interview, however, wasn't as seamless: I took a cab to the local airport, where I arrived [more than a couple of hours early](https://www.theonion.com/dad-suggests-arriving-at-airport-14-hours-early-1819573933), flew down to São Paulo, then took two more flights until I reached my final destination, some _thirty hours_ after I left my house, then I took another cab to the fancy hotel booked by my not-to-be future company and collapsed for the night.

Next day I had the onsite (which took basically the full business hours), then back to the hotel, collapsed again. On the third day I backtracked through the 30 hours of cabs, airports and flights back home. This was late December, by the way, and pre-Covid, so airports were packed. A couple of days later, on Christmas eve, I got a very thoughtful _happy holidays + no thanks_ call from the recruiter.

Might I have gotten the job if I had taken a bus instead of multiple planes? Maybe, maybe not. That isn't really the point, though, and as far as _anecdata_ goes, I have an opposite example as well: I interviewed twice at the same company, once through a tortuous voyage similar to the one I described above, and another time at my city, with the roles reversed: I left my house and drove for a few minutes to the onsite, while the interviewers were staying at a fancy hotel after making the multi-airplane trip. I failed the former and got an offer from the latter. I'm the same person applying for the same job at the same company. Did I just perform better? Did they perform "worse"? Who knows, right?

But I digress. Back to the matter at hand: if you think of it, the _60 hours_ of commuting alone is more than one work week. If you factor in the actual onsite, then we're well into _two workweeks_ of effort put into a supposedly trivial, everyday, no-strings attached business interview. The elapsed wall time is well into a full business week as well, as the flights alone will set you back at least two and a half full days (you'll probably not be able to work waiting at airports or in the hotel room -- I've tried and failed at both).

Perhaps surprisingly, "onsites" are still a thing during the covid pandemic -- they're just remote, i.e., _not really onsites at all_! This is immensely beneficial for everyone involved: the company won't have to pay for expensive hotels and plane tickets, the planet won't have to pay for the huge CO2 emissions from this ultimately unnecessary shenanigan, and above all the candidate won't have to waste a week of his/her vacation time with something as ethereal as pursuing a software engineering job.

Let us remember that the success of job searches depends on arbitrary things like if everyone on the panel likes your face. We all know things shouldn't be this way; we're supposed to be unbiased and empathetic, but let's face it -- we humans [_suck_](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200714101228.htm) at that. _That guy has a weird hairdo, hmmm... totally unrelated, but are we sure he can handle our super complicated CRUD app?_

Its not like this is some sad-sack, sour grapes excuse out of being bad at the job either -- no matter how technically proficient you are, _you suck_ at interviews. Its not you -- its the process:

<blockquote>"The fact that people who are overall pretty strong (e.g. mean ~= 3) can mess up technical interviews as much as 22% of the time shows that there’s definitely room for improvement in the process" - <a href="https://blog.interviewing.io/technical-interview-performance-is-kind-of-arbitrary-heres-the-data/">Technical interview performance is kind of arbitrary. Here’s the data.</a>
</blockquote>

Such a volatile thing as _interviewing for a job_ should **never** have been tied to multiple plane tickets and 2-night hotel stays in a different continent in the first place. **Never**.

The already mentioned cons outshine the pros like the `-8.208527` Sun outshines my laptop screen: you'll get to see our fantastic, totally unique office culture with your own two peepers! You'll get to visit our totally awesome, Potemkin-perfect city! Maybe if you're lucky you'll even get a taste of the exquisite avocado toast served in our company cafeteria!

Joking aside, of course there are reasonable motives for an onsite. Recruiters want to know if the candidate hates the cold and is going to churn early winter, or maybe the city is too small, or too big, or whatever random factor might make people want to run away. But are those things worth the several thousand dollars of expenses, and more importantly, are they worth excluding a possibly large pool of candidates that aren't willing to invest a full week of their time on a process with [naturally low chances of going forward](https://blog.interviewing.io/technical-interview-performance-is-kind-of-arbitrary-heres-the-data/)?

As a totally Empathetic™ company, you must consider: to the panel, an onsite means little more than sending an email; to the candidate, though, it might literally mean having to traverse the planet. If we take away the _traveling across the world_ part, both sides of the process will have similar costs and incentives regarding the onsite.

Recruitment in this industry is difficult; this is widely acknowledged by all parts involved. Literal onsites were a huge burden, and although the company usually takes on most of all of the financial hit, the time and emotional load was carried by the candidate alone. Getting rid of physical onsites is _fantastic_ news for everyone -- especially people interviewing, but also companies that can carry out a faster, more diverse recruitment process and the planet that will have God-knows-how-many less thousand tonnes of CO2 spewed each year.
