A couple of years ago I interviewed at one of the largest Ruby shops out there. Screening went well, and some days later I was invited for an onsite.

Well, what _is_ an onsite? I'd like to argue it is different things for different people, and introduces bias into our industry's already problematic hiring process.

<%= render('/image.*', src: '/blog/assets/images/2021/hiring-1.png', alt: "Search results for 'hiring is broken' on Algolia's HN search page.", caption: "Sounds like hiring isn't in a great shape.") %>

If you're a local, an onsite probably means taking a bus, metro, taxi, walking, whatever. If you're not local but are at least within the same country that you're interviewing, it might take a day trip or maybe a short flight. If you're a foreigner it might take travel visas and a week of travel.

"Time is money". The catchphrase has an obvious meaning for any salaried worker, but the _time investment_ one makes -- be it renovating a kitchen or traveling for an onsite -- is also a powerful psychological factor. Who can say that a candidate that took the bus to an onsite is going to have the same performance as a candidate that took a red-eye flight? Time investment alone put into traveling back and forth is enough to powerfully influence the interview.

Back to my story: I was interviewing for a company overseas. I happened to have a valid visa for that country, which already puts me in some advantage compared to others. Physically getting to the company building for the interview, however, wasn't as seamless: I took a cab to the local airport, where I arrived [more than a couple of hours early](https://www.theonion.com/dad-suggests-arriving-at-airport-14-hours-early-1819573933), flew down to São Paulo, then took two more flights until I reached my final destination, some _thirty hours_ after I left my house, then I took another cab to the fancy hotel booked by my not-to-be future company, collapsed for the night, took another cab the next day and arrived at the onsite.

Next day I had the onsite (which spread across most of the business hours), then back to the hotel, collapsed again; and finally on the third day I backtracked through the 30 hours of cabs, airports and flights back home. This was late December, by the way, and pre-Covid, so airports were packed. A couple of days later, on Christmas eve, I got a very thoughtful happy holidays + rejection call from their recruiter.

If you think of it, the _60 hours_ of commuting alone is more than one work week. If you factor in the actual onsite, then we're well into _two workweeks_ of effort put into a supposedly trivial, everyday, no-strings attached business interview. The elapsed wall time is well into a full business week as well, as the flights alone will set you back at least two and a half full days (you'll probably not be able to work waiting at airports or in the hotel room -- I've tried and failed at both).

Perhaps surprisingly, "onsites" are still a thing during the covid pandemic -- they're just remote, i.e., _not really onsites at all_! This is immensely beneficial for everyone involved: the company won't have to pay for expensive hotels and plane tickets, the planet won't have to pay for the huge CO2 emissions from this ultimately unnecessary shenanigan, and above all the candidate won't have to waste a week of his/her vacation time with something as ethereal as pursuing a software engineering job.

Let us remember that the success of such a pursuit depends on things like if everyone on the panel likes your face. We all know that things shouldn't be that way, that we're supposed to be unbiased and empathetic, but let's face it -- we humans _suck_ at that. _That guy has a weird hairdo, hmmm... totally unrelated, but are we sure he can handle our super complicated CRUD app?_

Such a volatile thing should _never_ have been tied to multiple plane tickets and 2-night hotel stays in a different continent. _Never_. The already mentioned cons outshine the pros like the `-8.208527` Sun outshines my laptop screen: you'll get to _see_ our fantastic, totally unique office culture with your own two peepers! You'll get to _visit_ our totally awesome, Potemkin-perfect city! Maybe if you're lucky you'll even get a taste of the famous avocado toast served in our company cafeteria!

Joking aside, of course there are reasonable motives for an onsite. As a recruiter you'll want to know if the candidate hates cold and is going to churn at the first sleet, or maybe find out that the perfect city isn't really perfect, get bored and move elsewhere, and so on. But are those things worth the several thousand dollars of expenses, and more importantly, are they worth excluding a possibly large pool of candidates that don't want to invest a full week of their time on processes that are universally accepted to be essentially flawed and often prejudiced?

Then there's the other side to consider, in case we really want to put on the Empathy™ hat: an onsite might set back the company a few thousand dollars, but that's still _peanuts_ compared to the time invested by the candidate in the process. It might take an interview panel half an hour to agree on an onsite, so there's also a _huge_ perceptual bias going on: to the panel, an onsite means little more than pressing a button, while to the candidate it might literally mean having to traverse the planet.

Recruitment in this industry is difficult; this is widely acknowledged by all parts involved. Literal onsites were a huge burden, and although the company usually takes on most of all of the financial burden, the time and emotional burden was carried solely by the candidate. Getting rid of them is _fantastic_ news for everyone -- especially people interviewing, but also companies that can carry out a faster, more diverse recruitment process and the planet that will have God-knows-how-many less thousand tonnes of CO2 spewed each year.
