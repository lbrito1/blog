A couple of years ago I interviewed at probably the largest Ruby shop out there. Screening went very well and I was invited for an onsite.

What does an onsite mean? It means different things for different people. If you're a local, it means taking a bus, metro, taxi, walking, whatever. If you're a national, it might take a day trip or maybe a short plane ride. If you're a foreigner it might take a week.

As far as this company is concerned, I was a foreigner. I took one cab trip to my local airport, where I arrived [more than a couple of hours early](https://www.theonion.com/dad-suggests-arriving-at-airport-14-hours-early-1819573933), as this was going to be a many-legged international flight. The first flight down to SÃ£o Paulo took over 3 hours. There were two other connections until I reached my final destination, some _thirty hours_ after I left my house. Then I took another cab to the very nice hotel booked by my not-to-be future company and collapsed. The next day I had the onsite then backtracked the 30 hours of cabs, airports and flights back home.

The _60 hours_ of commuting alone is more than one work week; if you factor in the actual onsite, then we're well into _two workweeks_ of effort put into a supposedly trivial interview. Elapsed wall time is also at least one full business week.

Surprisingly, "onsites" are still a thing during the covid pandemic --
