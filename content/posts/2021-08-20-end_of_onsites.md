A couple of years ago I interviewed at probably the largest Ruby shop out there. Screening went very well and I was invited for an onsite.

What does an onsite mean? It means different things for different people. If you're a local, it means taking a bus, metro, taxi, walking, whatever. If you're a national, it might take a day trip or maybe a short plane ride. If you're a foreigner it might take travel visas and a week of travel.

As far as this company is concerned, I was a foreigner. Thankfully, I happened to have a valid visa to get there. So I took one cab trip to my local airport, where I arrived [more than a couple of hours early](https://www.theonion.com/dad-suggests-arriving-at-airport-14-hours-early-1819573933), as this was going to be a many-legged international flight. The first flight down to SÃ£o Paulo took over 3 hours. There were two other connections until I reached my final destination, some _thirty hours_ after I left my house. Then I took another cab to the very nice hotel booked by my not-to-be future company and collapsed for the night. Next day was the onsite, then backtracking the 30 hours of cabs, airports and flights back home.

The _60 hours_ of commuting alone is more than one work week; if you factor in the actual onsite, then we're well into _two workweeks_ of effort put into a supposedly trivial affair. Wall time is well into a full business week as well, as the flights alone will set you back at least two and a half full days.

Surprisingly, "onsites" are still a thing during the covid pandemic -- they're just remote, i.e., _not really onsites at all_. This is immensely beneficial for everyone involved: the company won't have to pay for expensive hotels and plane tickets, the planet won't have to pay for the huge CO2 emissions from this ultimately unnecessary shenanigan, and above all the candidate won't have to waste a week of his/her vacation time with something as ethereal as pursuing a software engineering job.

Let us remember that the success of such a pursuit depends on things like if everyone on the panel likes your face and mannerisms, is on a bad day, or if you caught a stomach flu with the hotel food. Such a volatile thing should _never_ have been tied to multiple plane tickets and 2-night hotel stays in a different continent.

An onsite might set the company back a few thousand dollars for relatively expensive things like plane tickets and hotels, but that's peanuts compared to the time invested by the candidate in a process that seldom results in an offer. Also, it might take an interview panel half an hour to agree on an onsite, so there's a _huge_ perceptual bias going on: to the panel, an onsite means little more than writing an email and waiting a few days, while to the candidate it might literally mean having to traverse the planet.

Recruitment in this industry is difficult; this is acknowledged by all parts involved. Literal onsites were a huge burden carried mostly by the candidate. Getting rid of them is _fantastic_ news for everyone -- especially candidates.

Going back to my story: I got home a few days before Christmas; on Christmas eve I got a call from the recruiter thanking me for my time, but one of the people in the panel didn't quite like the project I described, so _thanks, but no thanks. Have a nice holiday._
