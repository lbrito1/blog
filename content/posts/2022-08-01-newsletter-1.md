Greetings!

This is the first newsletter I'm sending. If you've subscribed, it probably was because of the [Repurposing an old Android phone as a web server](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31841051) post on Hacker News (or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/vid7gi/web_server_on_an_android_phone/ie3tw9z/?context=3)). Its interesting how these things pick up, as I had submitted the _exact same_ link to Hacker News [just a few days](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31756734) before and it sank with no comments.

Anyway, the Hacker News itself was interesting because it generated the first amount of "real" traffic that my phone-server had to handle! The first few hours after it was posted recorded around 10k visits -- I remember looking at the panel at the time and calculating there was one request every other second. Traffic slowly went back to the usual volume after about 10 days. I have no idea if requests were dropped by nginx and the actual count was higher, but given the other metrics (# of comments on HN, # of views on Reddit etc) I don't really have reason to believe that was the case. I guess we can say the phone handled things well.

This leaves the question: what to write in this newsletter? At first I thought about sharing interesting links and discussions I've stumbled upon; but we all have too many tabs open already. Another idea came to me -- whoever subscribed probably enjoyed my writing, and I've long had the habit of writing thoughts on books I've read. Instead of defaulting to Goodreads, why not post book reviews here?

So there's our first newsletter!
