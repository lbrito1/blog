Using our implementation of a doubly linked (DL) list, we can very simply build the most basic LIFO (last in, first out) data structure: the stack.

<%= render('/image.*', caption: 'stac', src: '/blog/assets/images/codedeposit/2014/03/stack.png?w=300') %>

Stacks have two basic operations: push and pop. Push pushes data onto the stack (i.e., end of the DL list) and pop pops data off the list's tail, which is only possible because we can set the new tail as tail->prev, since we're using a DL list, with previous pointers. Another useful function is peek, which returns a pointer to the stack's top.

<!-- more -->

The only extra care we need here is to remind ourselves that pop only logically removes the element from the stack, so we'll have to free the data after we're done using it.

Here's the code with printable tests, as usual.
