Last time I decided to change jobs, I immediately felt overloaded by the abundance of options. My few years of experience as a full-stack web developer fit well within job descriptions everywhere, and the job postings themselves were posted all over:
* Glassdoor
* AngelList
* Linkedin
* Hacker News' Who's hiring/Who wants to be hired
* A growing number of Triplebyte-like platforms

This was a long way from the handful of half-decent local companies willing to take in a junior developer back when I graduated. I had to set up a Trello board to keep track of the 39 jobs I applied to (over the span of a couple of years).

## Deciding where to go

With the large universe of choices comes the problem: where to go? In [obnoxious business jargon](http://unsuck-it.com/) (trigger warning) this would be called **strategic** planning.

Programmer jobs are pretty much everywhere. Its really up to you to narrow down the globe into a handful of places you'd actually want to live (and work).

The purely financial analysis can be narrowed down to three things:

* Average software engineer salaries
* Taxation
* Cost of living

Those are overall parameters -- you might get a sweet offer in a low-paying market, of course. But when you have to consider the whole world as an option, having these broad parameters on a country-level is very helpful.

I was kind of surprised that there's no webapp that combines those three factors, but after investigating some, it makes sense.

Cost of Living is a pretty open/public information, easily obtainable on sites like Numbeo -- they even have an API. Tax is a little trickier: there are endless special cases, tax classes, exemptions, specific local/provincial/state taxes, etc, but it is still in the end publicly available information. Helpful APIs can be found, but are more geared towards sales taxes for obvious reasons (there's a product right there!).

Salary, however, is totally different. There's no single source of truth except for each countries' own IRS, and it is obviously confidential information.

## Applying and keeping track

There are a few large players in the recruitment industry, so the first step of most job searches are reasonably consolidated. They're almost always:
* Widely-used hiring platform (like Lever);
* Recruitment agency where recruiters act as middlemen between you and prospective companies;
* Recruitment-as-a-Service companies where you create a profile and either wait for companies to contact you or apply to the companies you're interested in.
