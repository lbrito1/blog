Immigration sucks. In addition to the personal toll it takes on anyone, it is also mind-numbingly tedious and of a baroque complexity. Why things aren't simpler by now?

This reminded me of the so-called "digital nomad visas". Searching for that term will get you a thousand clickbaitey Wordpress sites with the "20 best countries with nomad visas" or whatever. But how real are they _really_?

I'll admit the term sounds pretty cool. It sounds like something you'll be doing on your phone, as opposed to over the hundreds of PDF files and scanned documents a normal application will demand.

In fact, the name is so enticing I'm pretty sure that's the whole point. It is so radically opposite to idea of traditional visas that people can't help but think that _they are_ opposites:

| |traditional visa|digital nomad visa|
|-|-|-|
|**Requirements**|Many|Few|
|**Application process**|Hard, time-consuming, complex, lots of paper documents and legalese|Easy, fast, simple, lots of e-documents|
|**Time**|Measured in aeons|Measured in days|
|**Path to full residency**|Tortuous|Streamlined|
|**Uniqueness**|Unique|Same/similar between countries|
|**Time limits**|Constrained|Unconstrained|
|**Coolness**|Minivan heading to football practice|Convertible doing doughnuts|

**What people think is going on ☝️**

What really goes on is that these digital thingies are almost always just a rebranding of old the same old temporary work-based immigration visas. They are "a thing" because they have always been around under different advertising. 

Now the _idea_ we have of how they ought to be -- the happy second column above -- that's something else, and I can't see it becoming a thing, ever, because no matter what shiny wrapping you put around immigration, it is still immigration. Countries that have painful processes have them for a reason -- put simply there are more people willing to go through the process than they need, so they can be picky. That fundamental reality isn't going to change just because we have this new expectation due to this shiny new term.

All countries have the same basic incentive for getting more of these "digital nomads": high salaries, meaning taxes and consumption. How important that might be varies between countries, which explains the list of countries that have some kind of "digital nomad" visa -- so none of the larger world economies are usually on these lists. If they are, the requirements are so divergent from the happy idea above that we can't honestly say they're not a normal temporary work or rich-person visa.

The closest thing I've seen to a "true" digital nomad visa is [Estonia's](https://www.e-resident.gov.ee/nomadvisa/). They seem truly committed to the same ideals we described, and the process seems fairly straightforward. Its the exception that confirms the rule, sadly.
