<p>I’ve been using LinkedIn basically since I started working as an intern back in 2012. My usage is mostly limited to posting my blog posts, except the couple of times I used the platform to search for a new job. So most of the time, LinkedIn has been pretty slow-paced, with maybe half a dozen random recruiters reaching out per year.</p>

<p>However, since the Covid-19 pandemic started, and particularly in 2021, things seem to have gone a little crazy, with a <em>lot</em> more recruiter activity. I was curious to see just how much things had changed, so I looked at LinkedIn’s data export.</p>

</div>

<p>Communicating well with your co-workers and managers is supremely important to a software developer, and even more so for the remote one. With a lot more remote workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this topic became a lot more relevant.</p>

<p>I’ve seen people hint at this more than a few times over the years, but I didn’t really “get it” until I started working as a fully remote engineer. I also find it important to understand not only <em>what</em> we should be doing to achieve efficient communication, but also <em>why</em> we should be doing those things in those ways.</p>

<p>To me, the single most important thing to keep in mind is that people’s mental resources: time, attention span, etc, like yours, are limited.</p>

<p>Here’s something I’ve been wanting to write for a while: all the times (the ones I can remember, anyway) I bombed a software engineer job interview. There are so many “how I aced interviewing at X”/”how to pass X interview” floating around that I thought the opposite story would make for an amusing read.</p>

<p>My first developer job was as an intern at a big tech company in 2012. I think that was one of the worst interviews I’ve had, by the way – I could barely understand the interviewer over the cellphone, and those were the days of “how many piano players are there in New York”-kind of questions. I thought it went terrible, but I got the job somehow. On the other hand I’ve had many interviews I thought I did great but bombed anyway.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I interviewed at one of the largest Ruby shops out there. Screening went well, and some days later I was invited for an onsite.</p>

<p>These were the good old pre-covid days, so an onsite really meant <em>onsite</em>. You had to travel to the office, wherever that was.</p>

<p>The thing is, an onsite is actually radically different depending on <em>where you live</em>. It follows that onsites introduce further bias into our industry’s already problematic hiring process. I’d like to argue that although onsites have some advantages, they’re mostly a waste of time (and money).</p>

<p>Immigration sucks. In addition to the personal toll it takes on anyone, it is also mind-numbingly tedious and baroquely complex. Why aren’t things <strong>better</strong> by now?</p>

<p>This reminded me of the so-called “digital nomad visas”. Searching for that term will get you a thousand clickbaitey Wordpress sites with the “20 best countries with nomad visas” or whatever. But how real are they <em>really</em>?</p>
