<p>Since moving to Vancouver metro I‚Äôm continuously surprised with how common electric vehicles have become. Some may see the rise of EVs as an exciting turn towards a futuristic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk">solarpunk</a> utopia. I see the opposite: they are a dystopia of sorts. They are a dead end, a waste of resources in the wrong direction, a false hope.</p>

<p>The proliferation of personal electric vehicles is a strong marker of failure. It is a manifestation in the physical world of our inability as a society to move on from a clearly failed, car-centric way of living. Teslas kind of epitomize this ‚Äì despite being just another very expensive car, despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/27/tesla-catches-fire-vancouver-canada-investigation">catching fire</a> <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/sac-metro-fire-challenged-by-burning-tesla/ar-AAYnuYV">every</a> <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/nhtsa-steps-up-tesla-investigation-of-phantom-braking-crashes-into-emergency-vehicles/ar-AAYhkQk">now</a> <a href="https://fox2now.com/news/illinois/tesla-catches-fire-on-route-3-in-brooklyn-illinois/">and then</a>, despite <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/38579/these-repair-bulletins-for-teslas-quality-problems-are-downright-embarrassing-and-serious">bizarre QC issues</a>, despite its <a href="https://www.truthorfiction.com/did-elon-musk-tweet-we-will-coup-whoever-we-want-deal-with-it/">nitwit CEO</a>, still they are seen as cool and fashionable and trendy.</p>

<p>EVs are just an incremental improvement on cars. This painful reality hit me when I first <em>heard</em> an EV whooshing down the street: I couldn‚Äôt really tell it apart from any other vehicle. Over the years I had read so many hyped articles about how EVs were so quiet that they needed artificial sounds to warn pedestrians that I expected nothing less than library-level quietness from an EV. Instead I heard the same deafening roar as any other car.</p>

<p>It turns out that if you put a tonne of metal on rubber tires going on asphalt, that rubber-on-surface sound is likely the dominant noise source at any appreciable speed:</p>

<blockquote>"Tire-pavement interaction noise (TPIN) dominates for passenger vehicles with the speed of above 40 km/h and for trucks with the speed of 70 km/h."</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328012268_Literature_review_of_tire-pavement_interaction_noise_and_reduction_approaches">Literature review of tire-pavement interaction noise and reduction approaches, Tan Li, 2018</a></p>

<p>As speed increases, it quickly doesn‚Äôt matter if you even have an engine at all, as aerodynamic noise also factors in:</p>

<div class="image-box stretch">

      <img class="lazy " data-src="/blog/assets/images/2022/car-noise.png" alt="Chart with noise sources of cars by speed. At 15mph or so, propulsion noise gives way to tire-pavement noise as the largest source.">

      </noscript>
    </a>
  </div>
  
    <div class="image-caption">Past 15mph or so, propulsion noise is no longer the largest noise source.</div>
  
</div>

<p>So the sound will be the same. So will other things: the parking space it requires is the same, the urban sprawl it stimulates is the same, the accidents are the same (<a href="https://jalopnik.com/teslas-navigate-is-worse-than-human-driving-consumer-r-1834944173">or worse</a>). Everything that matters is basically the same.</p>

<p>For all the <a href="https://thedriven.io/2021/12/21/tesla-model-3-and-model-y-get-dancing-lights-in-2021-holiday-update/">distracting ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù</a> of these high-tech gizmos, in essence <em>they are still just cars</em>. No matter how much high tech is embedded into them, they are ontologically the same as the first Model T.</p>

<p>The most obvious improvement of EVs is in energy efficiency/pollution. Ironically this seems to be a very old pro-car argument. In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities"><em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</em></a>, written over half a century ago, Jane Jacobs notes that early car proponents defended the personal vehicle as <em>cleaner</em> than its predecessor ‚Äì horses. Internal combustion engines don‚Äôt poop, so the streets were in fact cleaner than before. That is all fair and just; she argued that the issue, however, was that horses were being replaced with <em>far too many</em> cars ‚Äì in other words, the one-car-per-person model of North America. Essentially the same argument about cleanliness is being repeated now, a century later, with EVs.</p>

<p>Pollution spewing from combustion engines, although a serious issue, was never the only nor the greatest problem caused by cars (and EVs <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/02/01/south-america-s-lithium-fields-reveal-the-dark-side-of-our-electric-future">still generate plenty pollution</a>, just not inside the engine, but in power plants and factories). It is disingenuous to pretend otherwise.</p>

<p>The rise of EVs is so disheartening because it is a huge missed opportunity and waste of resources. Even more so because it is being <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/08/business/biden-uaw-electric-vehicles-climate/index.html">pushed by</a> and within rich Western economies, that tend to lead the way to the rest of the world. Climate change, failing cities and fossil fuel scarcity could have catalyzed a new era of major public transit infrastructure projects and a shift in zoning practices towards sane densification. But those things are hard ‚Äì culturally and politically ‚Äì and people will do basically anything to avoid having to do them.</p>

<p>EVs are the perfect kludge that enables us to do nothing. People get a clean conscience thinking they are ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù, while not really addressing the underlying issue (and <a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/the-environmental-impact-of-lithium-batteries/">creating some brand new problems</a> as well). <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/vancouver-residents-rally-against-broadway-plan-1.5893686">Selfish NIMBYism</a> and infinite sprawl can carry on unbothered.</p>
