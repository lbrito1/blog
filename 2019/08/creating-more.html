      <p>I began blogging in the now prehistoric late 2000s.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve done a few blogs about different subjects (computer science, algorithms, web development, short stories and political ramblings). I‚Äôve had blogs on Blogspot, Wordpress and, more recently, Medium.</p>

<p>Those platforms were (or are, I suppose) an easy way to spew your ideas over the Internet while also being nice and comfy for other people to actually read (this last point is important for the CSS-challenged such as yours truly). In other words, those services Got Shit Done‚Ñ¢.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Alas, as I opened my eyes to the wonders of web development I started noticing a few things. First, Wordpress is written in PHP, which is gross (just kidding). Second, you don‚Äôt really control much: you can pick themes or whatever, but you won‚Äôt have the full control you‚Äôd have by creating a website from scratch or nearly scratch. Third, and maybe a corollary to the previous point, that stuff is <em>bloated</em>. There‚Äôs approximately 3 terabytes of mostly useless JavaScript, ads and all kind of crap I don‚Äôt care about.</p>

<p>But most importantly, I understood the hidden costs of most ‚Äúfree‚Äù web services. You don‚Äôt really own anything. You provide content, and Wordpress or Google or whoever package that content into a neat bundle and servce it to your audience together with whatever else (<em>cough, trackers</em>) they see fit.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs one of the reasons that pushed me towards a less-walled-garden approach towards blogging. But there‚Äôs a nother reason as well.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://code.divshot.com/geo-bootstrap/">many others</a>, I have fond memories of the late-90s/early-2000s Web 1.0 Internet. There is something warm and fuzzy about those beautifully terrible Geocities pages. They pierced the eyes of the viewer but were wondrous in a way. As I said, I‚Äôm not alone: Web 1.0 nostalgia is definitively <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835">on the rise</a>.</p>

<p>But why? What is not to like in our world of beautiful walled gardens? Surely it is better than those gross-looking Web 1.0 fan sites about some crappy GameBoy game, right? ‚Ä¶Right?</p>

    <div class="image-caption">We're soooo cooler than this in 2019.</div>

<p><em>Wrong.</em></p>

<p>Well, in many ways the Internet has of course improved over time. It has useful things like search engines and Wikipedia, and convenient subscription-based entertainment like Netflix. It has a whole bunch of nice stuff I could spend hours blabbering about.</p>

<p>But it also has a lot of problems. At this point there are surely many PhD theses about most of them, so I won‚Äôt bother. I‚Äôm just going to recommend one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html">New York Times article</a> that explains how YouTube indirectly helped elect a buffoon that <a href="https://extra.globo.com/noticias/brasil/bolsonaro-faz-piada-com-oriental-tudo-pequenininho-ai-veja-video-rv1-1-23668287.html">makes high school-tier penis jokes</a> as president of Brazil.</p>

<p>Now, the specific problem with today‚Äôs Internet that I feel is most relevant regarding blogging is how we‚Äôre gravitating towards all these ‚Äúfree‚Äù services all the time. Medium, for instance, is so <em>nice looking</em> that one doesn‚Äôt even think of perhaps using something else. But what happens when <em>everyone</em> uses Medium? First: all the blogs look exactly the same, which is lame. Second, Medium gets all that content and traffic for itself, for free.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone is skilled enough to build a personal blog from scratch. I am just barely able, as you can see from my lackluster front-end skills (I promise you I‚Äôm good on back-end things). So I‚Äôm definitively not dismissing the inclusiveness that services like Medium offer.</p>

<p>But as I searched for a way out of the walled gardens and fiddled with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for a while, I figured I might as well just <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/">build something to call my own</a>.</p>

<h2 id="so-i-built-this">So I built this.</h2>

<p>The goals were to create the simplest possible blogging system with as little fluff as possible. It should meet what I defined as basic blogging needs: list posts, show post, use tags, use images etc. And also not have 3 terabytes of JavaScript split in 90 requests just to show a fancy menu button.</p>

<p>So I started messing with Nanoc, an excellent Ruby library for static page generation, and came up with <a href="https://github.com/lbrito1/sane-blog-builder">this bad boy</a>.</p>

<p>I won‚Äôt pretend these ideas are new. They aren‚Äôt! I feel there‚Äôs been an increasing amount of <a href="https://code.divshot.com/geo-bootstrap/">Web 1.0 nostalgia</a> going on, and a big part of that is probably fueled by <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/">similar sentiments</a> as those I described. The <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">longing for simplicity</a> in a world of trillions of new JS frameworks is also quite widespread these days.</p>

<p>This small project is nothing special. There are <a href="https://github.com/remko/blog-skeleton">much better projects</a> <a href="https://clarkdave.net/2012/02/building-a-static-blog-with-nanoc/">available for free</a> on the Internet done by people that actually know what they‚Äôre doing with a CSS file. This here is just a tiny vase with some ugly flowers ‚Äì it would be ridiculous to compare it to the beautiful walled gardens of Medium or Wordpress. But, ugly as they are, they‚Äôre <strong>mine</strong>!</p>
