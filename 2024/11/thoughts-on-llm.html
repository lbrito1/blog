      <p>The “catastrophe scenario” of AI in the software engineering job market has gained quite a lot of popularity, with people pointing out that current models already “do a better job” (what does that even mean?) than many professional programmers. I’m not sure I completely buy into this.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Personally, I’ve found that the most useful use of LLMs during software development is to speed up tasks that I <em>already know</em> how to do, such as “write a spec suite with these scenarios”. The results are usually reasonably good, and with some careful nudging into the right direction, I usually get things done much faster than I would have otherwise. This is fundamentally different from having a chatbot fully <em>replace</em> me as a programmer.</p>

<p>I began by saying I don’t buy into the fear hype, but things get complicated when you look at the big picture. The way I described using LLMs is similar or analogous as to the way an engineering manager might assign feature work to developers, or a lead programmer working along a junior programmer: I have these tasks in mind, I have a clear idea of how to get them done, and I offload to it to this thing that will hopefully spit out more or less what I was expecting. And in that similarity lays the potential issue - given enough people in the industry are using it in this same way, the necessity of more junior developers might diminish.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at this is through productivity. I’m probably not producing better code, but I am definitively producing code much faster than before. Let’s assume this is an industry-wide trend. Other programmers are similarly experiencing increases in productivity. So, all other things equal, the industry suddenly has a considerable surplus of productivity. Where is it going? Its still too early to investigate - ChatGPT 3 came out in 2020, and only in the last couple of years have the models become very good at code. But <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/assets/pdfs/2023Report.pdf">end of year</a> salary reports show no meaningful changes in software engineer salaries in the last couple of years. There are two other outlets for productivity: increasing profits and decreasing headcounts. We’ve seen plenty of both recently.</p>

<p>Also, if we zoom out a little and look at the overall economic productivity in the last decades:</p>

<p>There’s absolutely no reason to believe that trend will change. If anything, dumping more productivity into the economy will just supercharge the wage-productivity decoupling even further.</p>

<p>While I’m not personally frightened about being replaced by an LLM - at least not in the murky, barely-visible future - I do have some concerns about the wider industry, specifically for people joining the workforce right now.</p>
