<p>I’ve been using LinkedIn basically since I started working as an intern back in 2012. My usage is mostly limited to posting my blog posts, except the couple of times I used the platform to search for a new job. So most of the time, LinkedIn has been pretty slow-paced, with maybe half a dozen random recruiters reaching out per year.</p>

<p>However, since the Covid-19 pandemic started, and particularly in 2021, things seem to have gone a little crazy, with a <em>lot</em> more recruiter activity. I was curious to see just how much things had changed, so I looked at LinkedIn’s data export.</p>

<p>Here’s something I’ve been wanting to write for a while: all the times (the ones I can remember, anyway) I bombed a software engineer job interview. There are so many “how I aced interviewing at X”/”how to pass X interview” floating around that I thought the opposite story would make for an amusing read.</p>

<p>My first developer job was as an intern at a big tech company in 2012. I think that was one of the worst interviews I’ve had, by the way – I could barely understand the interviewer over the cellphone, and those were the days of “how many piano players are there in New York”-kind of questions. I thought it went terrible, but I got the job somehow. On the other hand I’ve had many interviews I thought I did great but bombed anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TLDR</strong> A simple metrics-based ranking system is good enough to decide who gets how many resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Computational resources – CPU time, memory usage, network traffic etc – are limited. This may be more or less of a problem depending on project/company size and so on; if you’re working on a smaller product with limited traffic, it might not be meaningful at all.</p>

<p>Once past a certain threshold though, expenses with such resources become non-trivial and it begins to make sense to spend some time thinking about how to distribute them as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem that got me thinking about this: at work, we had a computational resource that needed to be consumed by a large fleet of workers (think several thousand concurrent), but each <em>type</em> of worker had different <em>productivity</em>, and that productivity changed over time. How can we decide who gets what?</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I interviewed at one of the largest Ruby shops out there. Screening went well, and some days later I was invited for an onsite.</p>

<p>These were the good old pre-covid days, so an onsite really meant <em>onsite</em>. You had to travel to the office, wherever that was.</p>

<p>The thing is, an onsite is actually radically different depending on <em>where you live</em>. It follows that onsites introduce further bias into our industry’s already problematic hiring process. I’d like to argue that although onsites have some advantages, they’re mostly a waste of time (and money).</p>
