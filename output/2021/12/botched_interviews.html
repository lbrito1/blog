<p>Here’s something I’ve been wanting to write for a while: all the times (the ones I can remember, anyway) I bombed a software engineer job interview. There are so many “how I aced interviewing at X”/”how to pass X interview” floating around that I thought the opposite story would make for an amusing read.</p>

<p>My first developer job was as an intern at a big tech company in 2012. I think that was one of the worst interviews I’ve had, by the way – I could barely understand the interviewer over the cellphone, and those were the days of “how many piano players are there in New York”-kind of questions. I thought it went terrible, but I got the job somehow. On the other hand I’ve had many interviews I thought I did great but bombed anyway.</p>

<h2 id="faang-1-2013">FAANG 1 (2013)</h2>

<p>I was just out of school when I got a cold call from a FAANG recruiter asking if I was interested in interviewing there. Needless to say I was naive and didn’t quite know what I was getting myself into.</p>

<p>The first part of the process was a phone screen with a technical recruiter. She asked me something like “What is the fastest way to sum two 32-bit integers?”. I froze like a deer in the headlights.</p>

<p>After gasping in awe at the bizarre question and mumbling some nonsense, I was informed that my answer was <em>not</em> correct. The <em>right</em> answer, the recruiter said, was “using the CPU’s TLB”. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">translation lookaside buffer</a> is a memory cache located between the CPU and the CPU cache. I still had college classes in my somewhat-recent memory at the time, so I kind of knew that this thing existed, but to this day I still don’t know how to sum two integers with it.</p>

<h2 id="faang-1-2014">FAANG 1 (2014)</h2>

<p>A year passed and (the same) FAANG came to my town with a recruitment event. Again I got a call, and instead of a phone screening, I would go straight to the event location and do a quick onsite interview.</p>

<p>They provided recommendations on technical subjects I should refresh my memory about: basically Algorithms 101 syllabus; sorting algorithms, red/black and AVL trees, A* and Dijkstra, NP-complete problems, etc, as well as some operating systems topics: processes, threads, mutexes, scheduling algorithms and so on.</p>

<p>At the time I had just started grad school. I was a bit more seasoned than the last interview, but far from having any relevant industry experience.</p>

<p>Interview day. I got to the venue and sat reading my notes on how to balance AVL trees. The interviewers showed up, greeted me and got things started. They gave me pen and paper and asked me how to some things on a list of integers. I don’t recall the interview being particularly bad or anything, but round one was the end of the line for me. A few days later I got a boilerplate rejection email and that was my last contact with this FAANG.</p>

<h2 id="mid-sized-tech-2014">Mid-sized tech (2014)</h2>

<p>Grad school classes were few and far apart, so I decided to start looking for a job. This mid-sized tech company had a local office, so I got in touch and scheduled an interview.</p>

<p>I don’t remember any meaningful details from this interview. One thing I do remember is being asked what monthly compensation I expected. The interviewer passed me a scrap of paper and a pen for me to write the number down. I took a few moments to think and wrote down what I thought was an adequate number. In today’s US dollars, that number would be enough to afford a parking spot in San Francisco, but it was an okay salary for a junior hire in my town.</p>

<p>I didn’t get a lot of feedback here other than “we went with someone else”.</p>

<h2 id="faang-2-2019">FAANG 2 (2019)</h2>

<p>A few years had passed since my last failure. I had finished my education, become a Ruby developer and enjoyed a 3.5-years tenure at a great, small local software studio. I had a preferred text editor. I had dotfiles. I felt weathered. So I did what you’re supposed to do: I applied to FAANG.</p>

<p>FAANG responded to my application, and after a couple of <em>months</em> and being ghosted by one of the 5+ recruiters involved in the process, things got on track for the onsite.</p>

<p>I did the Leetcode thing daily. I read Glassdoor tips and talked to college friends that worked at this company. I even went on Blind and found out that you’re basically an idiot if you don’t pass FAANG’s interview, cause it’s so damn easy.</p>

<p>I passed the initial screening rituals and was invited for an onsite – 25 hours and 3 flights away. As I obsessively went through my notes in the hotel, I thought I was finally <em>ready</em>.</p>

<p>There were maybe 5 or 6 rounds, each with one or two interviewers, all very nice and moderately helpful. Pretty much textbook FAANG interview, just like CTCI describes it. I was asked a particularly difficult set of questions. Mid-interview, I got the familiar feeling that a train is steaming towards me and I’ll soon be smashed into smithereens. Looking back, I’d evaluate myself at this interview as Not Good.</p>

<p>Another 25 hours, 2-stop travel back to my town. Feedback came swiftly in the familiar lukewarm rejection phone call.</p>

<h2 id="big-tech-2019">Big Tech (2019)</h2>

<p>This Big Tech company is highly respected in the Ruby community and their culture seemed to align with my own. I tried, and failed, their interview process two times.</p>

<p>They have a fairly straightforward interview process: first a phone screen/short code challenge, then a longer behavioral/technical challenge, typically onsite. First time, I didn’t make it to the onsite.</p>

<p>My second attempt was much smoother and lead to the onsite. Like <em>FAANG 1 (2019)</em>, this involved multiple flights and 20+ hours of travel. Also like my previous interview, I <em>felt ready</em>. The recruiter was great, and every person I met so far was extremely nice. Company culture seemed fantastic and I liked the tech stack.</p>

<p>There were two technical rounds, one cultural fit conversation and one technical-but-not-coding round. The coding parts went well, maybe a B+. The culture fit thing was very good. The not-coding part, ironically the one I had prepared the most, was a disaster, although I didn’t see things that way at the time.</p>

<p>I came prepared to talk about one of the projects I lead in my current job at the time; evidently I had an NDA in place and had to navigate around it. I thought this was fine – I had already published a post on the same subject on the company’s public blog and never had any complaints about it being too esoteric/abstract. The interviewer was not amused by this at all. Because of the vagueness of the language I was using, he seemed to think I was describing something shady. At one point, he actually asked something like “do your users know you are doing this”! Right now I think that was kind of funny, but I was utterly bewildered at the time. I tried to reassure him that there was nothing fishy going on, but at that point he had probably made his mind. I might as well have gone straight to the airport and saved everyone some time.</p>

<p>Rejection call came a week later. Upon my request, the recruiter followed with a very thorough email detailing the reasons of the rejection, which is a fairly unusual thing for these companies to do, and very helpful for the candidate. Although I think the interviewer could have handled the situation better (just ask me to describe another project), I have great respect for the way the company handled the process and gave honest feedback.</p>

<h2 id="the-printer-in-the-room">The printer in the room</h2>

<p>Hiring is the printer of software engineering jobs. It kind of works, but not very well, and everyone seems to agree it should be better at this point. This is in no way a demerit to recruiters – they’re doing their job and are not at fault here. They’re usually pretty good; its the framework that isn’t great. There have been some incremental improvements: code sharing platforms are pretty good, which makes remote interviewing very straightforward (and reduces the need for onsites, <a href="https://lbrito1.github.io/blog/2021/08/onsites.html">which suck</a>). There are many services where you build a single profile and apply to many companies at once, which reduces the time waste of filling the same forms in all the different companies’ websites. The bulk of the process remains more or less the same though.</p>

<p>Interviewing is in part a numbers game, but also not <em>entirely</em> random, which means there is a way to get better at it (that’s the whole point of companies like Leetcode and books like CTCI). Failing an interview you prepared for leaves a sour taste in the mouth, but over time it gets easier to accept as just part of the probability game.</p>
