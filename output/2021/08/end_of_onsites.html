    <h2>The end of onsites is great news for candidates</h2>
    <article class="text">
      <p>A couple of years ago I interviewed at probably the largest Ruby shop out there. Screening went very well and I was invited for an onsite.</p>

<p>What does an onsite mean? It means different things for different people. If you’re a local, it means taking a bus, metro, taxi, walking, whatever. If you’re a national, it might take a day trip or maybe a short plane ride. If you’re a foreigner it might take a week.</p>

<p>As far as this company is concerned, I was a foreigner. I took one cab trip to my local airport, where I arrived <a href="https://www.theonion.com/dad-suggests-arriving-at-airport-14-hours-early-1819573933">more than a couple of hours early</a>, as this was going to be a many-legged international flight. The first flight down to São Paulo took over 3 hours. There were two other connections until I reached my final destination, some <em>thirty hours</em> after I left my house. Then I took another cab to the very nice hotel booked by my not-to-be future company and collapsed. The next day I had the onsite then backtracked the 30 hours of cabs, airports and flights back home.</p>

<p>The <em>60 hours</em> of commuting alone is more than one work week; if you factor in the actual onsite, then we’re well into <em>two workweeks</em> of effort put into a supposedly trivial interview. Elapsed wall time is also at least one full business week.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, “onsites” are still a thing during the covid pandemic –</p>
