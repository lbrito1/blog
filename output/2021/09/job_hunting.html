<p>Last time I decided to change jobs, I immediately felt overloaded by the abundance of options. My few years of experience as a full-stack web developer fit well within job descriptions everywhere, and the job postings themselves were posted all over:
* Glassdoor
* AngelList
* Linkedin
* Hacker News’ Who’s hiring/Who wants to be hired
* A growing number of Triplebyte-like platforms</p>

<p>This was a long way from the handful of half-decent local companies willing to take in a junior developer back when I graduated. I had to set up a Trello board to keep track of the 39 jobs I applied to (over the span of a couple of years).</p>

<h2 id="deciding-where-to-go">Deciding where to go</h2>

<p>With the large universe of choices comes the problem: where to go? In <a href="http://unsuck-it.com/">obnoxious business jargon</a> (trigger warning) this would be called <strong>strategic</strong> planning.</p>

<p>Programmer jobs are pretty much everywhere. Its really up to you to narrow down the globe into a handful of places you’d actually want to live (and work).</p>

<p>The purely financial analysis can be narrowed down to three things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Average software engineer salaries</li>
  <li>Taxation</li>
  <li>Cost of living</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are overall parameters – you might get a sweet offer in a low-paying market, of course. But when you have to consider the whole world as an option, having these broad parameters on a country-level is very helpful.</p>

<p>I was kind of surprised that there’s no webapp that combines those three factors, but after investigating some, it makes sense.</p>

<p>Cost of Living is a pretty open/public information, easily obtainable on sites like Numbeo – they even have an API. Tax is a little trickier: there are endless special cases, tax classes, exemptions, specific local/provincial/state taxes, etc, but it is still in the end publicly available information. Helpful APIs can be found, but are more geared towards sales taxes for obvious reasons (there’s a product right there!).</p>

<p>Salary, however, is totally different. There’s no single source of truth except for each countries’ own IRS, and it is obviously confidential information.</p>

<h2 id="applying-and-keeping-track">Applying and keeping track</h2>

<p>There are a few large players in the recruitment industry, so the first step of most job searches are reasonably consolidated. They’re almost always:
* Widely-used hiring platform (like Lever);
* Recruitment agency where recruiters act as middlemen between you and prospective companies;
* Recruitment-as-a-Service companies where you create a profile and either wait for companies to contact you or apply to the companies you’re interested in.</p>
