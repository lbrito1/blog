          <p>The “catastrophe scenario” of AI in the software engineering job market has gained quite a lot of popularity, with people pointing out that current models already “do a better job” (what does that even mean?) than many professional programmers. I’m not sure I completely buy into this.</p>

<p>It’s been a year since I moved my company’s infrastructure away from AWS. Being in a small team that was unfamiliar with AWS, it was the right move. Having used Fly.io for side projects before, I went with them as our new host. While not perfect, the experience has been overall a great success.</p>

<p>The main motivation was how simple and hands-off Fly is, especially when compared with its polar opposite, AWS. There was quite a lot of infra cost savings as well. Here’s a quick summary of my overall experience and feeling on them.</p>

<p>After about two years living in metro Vancouver, I decided to leave. I’m in a smaller city in the Fraser Valley, and it has been great!</p>

<p>My first time in Vancouver was for an interview at Amazon in 2019. I stayed at a hotel near the downtown office for a couple of nights, which was less time than I spent in the 6 different airplanes and a similar number of airports to get there from Brazil. Then the pandemic happened. After almost two years waiting for the visa, I finally moved to Vancouver in late 2021.</p>

      <h2><a href="12/rails-credentials.html">Rails credentials: back to ENVs</a></h2>
      <aside class="">

      <article class="text">
          <p>Since Rails 5, Rails has had an encrypted <code>credentials.enc</code> file which you can use to store secrets like API tokens and passwords.</p>

<p>I’ve come to see the shortcomings of this approach, and now I’m back to the traditional way of storing secrets on environment variables.</p>

<p>Although it might be a simpler solution when starting out a new project, the long-term problems of credentials.enc are significant. For example: with Rails’ credentials, updating secrets is typically tied to redeploying of the app, which is much slower than simply restarting a VM (what you would do if you were using ENVs).</p>

<p>But the biggest drawback of using Rails’ credentials is that it inevitably leads to having more than one source of truth for your project’s secrets: eventually your project will have extra-Rails dependencies, and they obviously won’t read from Rails’ credentials. So you’ll end up with some API keys defined in <code>credentials.enc</code>, and some others defined elsewhere, like a <code>.env</code>. Better, then, to use <code>.env</code> from the start, and use something like Infisical for management and team access.</p>

          <p>I’ve been working on a side project with a friend for well over a year now, and in addition to the joy of working with someone you like on a problem of your choice, I’ve had quite a lot of “aha” (or “oh…”) moments.</p>

<p>We’re both basically happy with the state of our little project, with just a few small tweaks remaining before we can send it off into the world, except for one not-so-small thing: billing.</p>
