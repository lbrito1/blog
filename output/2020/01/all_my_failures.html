<p>That’s the closing line on a lot of posts found in anonymous software engineering internet boards.</p>

<p>If an alien civilization were to probe Earthlings and study the software engineering industry, they would conclude that all developers is insanely successful, earning nearly half a million dollars after barely leaving puberty.</p>

<p>Posts like “I got rejected from X company”, however, are much more elusive. Judging by what it sees on the internet, our spaceling would probably think that developer interviews are an exact science – read and practice a given topic for X hours and you’re golden.</p>

<p>I’d like to share a few of my failures, though.</p>

<!-- The Office gif fail -->

<h2 id="google-2013">Google (2013)</h2>

<p>I was just out of school when I got a cold call from a Google recruiter asking if I was interested in interviewing at the company. Would I, a 22-year old graduate from a public university in Brazil, want to interview at the world’s largest tech company at that time? Of course I would.</p>

<p>The first part of the process was a phone screen with a technical recruiter. She asked me something like “What is the fastest way to sum two 32-bit integers?”. The question hit me like a runaway truck smashing into a poor little kitten, smashing the animal into a 2-dimensional pancake of sub-atomic width. The die were cast before I even picked up the phone. I had no chance.</p>

<p>The “right” answer was “using the CPU’s translation lookaside buffer, TLB”. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">TLB</a> is a memory cache located between the CPU and the CPU cache. At that time I was fresh out of college, so I kind of knew that this thing existed, but till this day I still don’t know how to sum two integers with it.</p>

<p>Fail!</p>

<h2 id="google-2014">Google (2014)</h2>

<p>A year passed and Google came to town with a recruitment event. Again I got a call, and instead of a phone screening, I would go straight to the event location and do a quick onsite interview.</p>

<p>The technical preparation recommendations were basically the same as any algorithm book’s summary: efficient sorting algorithms, red/black and AVL trees, A* and Dijkstra, NP-complete problems, etc. The interviewee should also be knowledgeable about operating systems topics: processes, threads, mutexes, scheduling algorithms and so on. I vaguely remember studying most of those topics to my earnest.</p>

<p>I was a little more seasoned than the previous year, but still pretty fresh out of college. I was now on my first semester of grad school.</p>

<p>The interview day came. I got to the venue and sat reading my notes and flashcards on how to balance AVL trees. The interviewers showed up and we got things going. They gave me pen and paper and asked me a few questions on how to do a few things on a list of integers. I don’t remember how well I answered those questions. Probably not too well; a few days later I got a bland “thank you so much for your time, you’re awesome but we don’t have anything for you right now” email.</p>

<p>Fail!</p>

<h2 id="liferay-2014">Liferay (2014)</h2>

<p>Grad school classes were few and far apart, so I decided to pro-actively look for a job. Liferay had a local office in my town, so I got in touch and scheduled an interview.</p>

<p>I don’t remember any meaningful details from this interview. One thing I do remember is being asked what monthly compensation I expected, and if I recall correctly the interviewer solemnly passed me a scrap of paper and a pen for me to write the number down. We locked gazes for a second, I took a few moments to think and wrote down what I thought was a respectable, but adequate number. In today’s US dollars, that number would be enough to afford two parking spots in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I didn’t get a lot of feedback here other than “we went with someone else”. Maybe I should have asked for 1 parking spot instead of 2.</p>

<p>Fail!</p>

<h2 id="amazon-2019">Amazon (2019)</h2>

<p>A few years had passed since my last failure. I had finished my Masters, become a full-stack Ruby developer and enjoyed a 3,5-years tenure at a great software studio. I felt more prepared and, most importantly, weathered. So I did what you’re supposed to do when you’re a software engineer: I applied to FAANG.</p>

<p>Amazon responded to my application, and after a couple of ~months~ weeks and being ghosted by one of the 5+ recruiters involved in the process, things finally got on track for the onsite interview.</p>

<p>I grinded (ground?) Leetcode daily. I meticulously went through Jeff Bezos’ Leadership Principles. I read Glassdoor tips and talked to college friends that worked at Amazon. I even went on Blind, a 4chan-like board for computer nerds, where people posted that you’re basically an idiot if you don’t pass Amazon’s interview. I took the 25 hours 2-stop flight to Vancouver, British Columbia and went through my notes again and again in the fancy hotel room Mr. Bezos books for his potential employees. <em>I’ve finally got this! I’m ready!</em></p>

<p>Mid-interview, I got that familiar feeling: the A-train is running towards me, and soon I shall soon be smashed into smithereens. Over half a dozen friendly Amazonians quizzed me with a few whiteboard questions interchanged with behavioral Leadership Principles questions. When the evening was over, I was hoarse from 5+ hours of nearly nonstop talking.</p>

<p>Another 25 hours, 2-stop flight back to my town. Feedback came swiftly: the same bland, half-hearted “Thank you so much for your time, we hope to hear from you again in the future!” phone call.</p>

<p>Fail!</p>
