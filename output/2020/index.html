<p>Communicating well with your co-workers and managers is supremely important to a software developer, and even more so for the remote one. With a lot more remote workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this topic became a lot more relevant.</p>

<p>I’ve seen people hint at this more than a few times over the years, but I didn’t really “get it” until I started working as a fully remote engineer. I also find it important to understand not only <em>what</em> we should be doing to achieve efficient communication, but also <em>why</em> we should be doing those things in those ways.</p>

<p>To me, the single most important thing to keep in mind is that people’s mental resources: time, attention span, etc, like yours, are limited.</p>

<p>Do you have an old Android phone? Sure you do! There’s a mind-blowing amount of electronic waste of all kinds, and with the average person in developed countries <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/smartphone-users-are-waiting-longer-before-upgrading-heres-why.html">discarding their phones every couple of years</a>, discarded smartphones are probably one of the most common forms of e-waste.</p>

<p>I had an old Motorola G5 Cedric gathering dust, so I decided to do something with it – it is now running a Puma web server with a simple Sinatra webapp.</p>

<p>Now, before going any further, you might be thinking: what is the real, practical use of all this? An old Android phone probably isn’t going to have a stellar performance, but neither do those <code>t2.nano</code>s, honestly. I’m yet to deploy any “real” code on an Android, but even the cheaper and older phones do commonly have quad-core or even octa-core CPUs, and at least 2GB RAM, so at least in theory a phone <em>should</em> be close – ballpark, at least – to the most modest cloud IaaS offers our there (<code>t2.nano</code> has 512MB for instance). Of course, a phone has an ARM processor while IaaS usually are x86; memory management is entirely different as well, but still – we’re talking ballpark estimates here.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is a short tutorial on how to repurpose an Android device as a web server – or any number of different things, really.</p>

<p>I’ve struggled with some kind of problem with Nvidia graphics cards on Linux since forever.</p>

<p>Most commonly, an external monitor wouldn’t work or the dedicated card would refuse to power off when it should.</p>

<p>The latter problem – a power-hogging discrete Nvidia card not turning off when it isn’t needed, specifically in <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nvidia_Optimus">Optimus</a>-enabled laptops – has consistently haunted me throughout the years. At least in my experience, this problem is in that sweet spot of things that are definitively annoying and kind of inconvenient, but complicated enough not to be worth the several work-hours needed to definitively solve it.</p>
